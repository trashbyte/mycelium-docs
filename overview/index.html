		<h3>Server Structure</h3>

		<p>A server makes up a node on the network. A server is modular by design, and is comprised mainly of three parts: the keyring manager, a set of providers, and a set of adapters.</p>

		<p>The keyring manager is a service that maintains the keyrings for each persona. Each keyring consists of a keypair for the persona, a colleciton of endorsements, and a mapping of key signatures to public keys and endorsements, used to authenticate other users.</p>

		<p>Providers are services that provide the core, protocol-agnostic functionality of a server.</p>

		<p>Adapters are interfaces that providers can use to communicate with the world. A provider may register routes with any number of supported adapters. Each adapter runs only a single instance, which is needed for, e.g. all TCP/UDP services using the same port (80).</p>
