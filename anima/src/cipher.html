{{3:Allowed Hashing Algorithms}}

<p>Note that public key fingerprints must always be generated with SHA3-512 truncated to 192 bits as defined in <a href="#2.1">Part 2.1</a>.</p>

{{4:SHA2-512/256}}

<p>SHA version 2 using an internal state size of 512 (8×64) bits, truncated to 256 bits. Thanks to the use of truncation, this method is resistant to length extension attacks.</p>

{{4:SHA2-384}}

<p>SHA version 2 using an internal state size of 512 (8×64) bits, truncated to 384 bits. Less resistant against length extension attacks than SHA2-512/256, but better collision resistance.</p>

{{4:SHA3-256}}

<p>SHA version 3 using an internal state size of 1600 (5×5×64) bits, with an output size of 256 bits. Equivalent to SHA2-512/256 for collision resistance, significantly stronger against length extension attacks but more expensive to compute than SHA2.</p>

{{4:SHA3-384}}

<p>SHA version 3 using an internal state size of 1600 (5×5×64) bits, with an output size of 384 bits. Stronger than SHA3-256 but more expensive to compute.</p>

{{4:SHA3-512}}

<p>SHA version 3 using an internal state size of 1600 (5×5×64) bits, with an output size of 512 bits. Stronger than SHA3-384 but more expensive to compute.</p>

{{4:BLAKE2s-256}}

<p>BLAKE2 with an internal state size of 256 bits and an output size of 256 bits. Significantly better worst-case collision resistance than SHA2 or SHA3, while being faster than both. SHA2/3 are still included as they are more thoroughly tested.</p>

{{4:BLAKE2b-384}}

<p>BLAKE2 with an internal state size of 512 bits and an output size of 384 bits. Stronger variant of BLAKE2s-256.</p>

{{4:BLAKE2b-512}}

<p>BLAKE2 with an internal state size of 512 bits and an output size of 512 bits. Stronger variant of BLAKE2b-384.</p>

{{3:Disallowed Hashing Algorithms}}

{{4:MD4 and MD5}}

<p>Cryptographically broken and collisions can be generated in seconds.</p>

{{4:MD2}}

<p>Less vulnerable than MD4 or MD5 but still not considered secure. MD2 support has been removed from  OpenSSL, GnuTLS, and NSS.</p>

{{4:SHA0 and SHA1}}

<p>Cryptographically broken; generating collisions for SHA-1 is computationally feasible, and takes only around an hour for SHA-0 on commodity hardware.</p>

{{4:SHA2-224, SHA2-256, and SHA2-512}}

<p>All are vulnerable against length extension attacks.</p>

{{4:SHA3-224}}

<p>Weaker than SHA3-256 but with nearly identical computation time.</p>
